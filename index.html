  <h1></h1>
  <p>BETTER ?

someone who has been there  ,me,you,us
I've been through it
Not just a bad day,but all the seasons , 
When you wake up tired ,sleep numb, 
You just survive.

You eat but you never really taste, 
You smile but never feel it ,
 You talk ,but your voice feels distinct
 Its like you're watching yourself from far away

There was a time ,I didn't wanna hear 
"Things will get better" , 
It sounded fake,what people would say when they don't know what to say

Because when you're hurting,when everything's piling, 
Bills,loss , silence,friends fading 
Dreams falling through your fingers like sand 
You want proof ,not just clinches

But I didn't have , Pain became something I couldn't carry without collapsing
 I stopped hoping ,stopped expecting good 
Started bracing the next blow,next goodbye
The next crack in the ground beneath.

 know what you think ,
That the burden was lifted ,funny enough 
That I rose,stronger than ever ,
That the weight gave way to light 
But indeed ,

It made me sharp,cold with vengeance,
Dissapointment stopped mattering 
I took every fall ,loud and unapologetic
Caring meant bleeding ,and I was running dry

I wore my detachment like armour,
I called it peace in the absence of healing,
It was a quiet surrender, emptiness made me at ease
It whispered comfort 

I stopped fighting,I let darkness settle deep,
Because sometimes 
Sometimes ,
Surviving means giving up on feeling at all
Might be victory after all</p>
